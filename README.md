"3-Dimensional Modelling of Rib Fracture Patterns: Visualisation of Serratus Anterior Plane Block Outcomes"

This repository was created for a Masters Degree Capstone Project. The aim of this project was to visualise the effectiveness of the serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) on specific rib fracture patterns using a 3-dimensional thoracic model. With continual improvement and iterations, it will assist emergency and trauma clinicians in deciding the anatomical distribution of injuries that would benefit from the SAPB procedure, and in doing so pave the way for personalised treatment of rib fractures.
